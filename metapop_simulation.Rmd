## Introduction and Project Goals

This is an exploration of the use of matrix population models to explore
population dynamics in a metapopulation context, in which local populations
can be demographically open or closed, and vary in their demographic rates,
especially in the survival of YOY, or new recruits.  First, the model formulation
will be general, then I will attempt to parameterize it for specific species.

Much of the model formulation is based on Caswell (2001) and adapted from
Armstrong(2002). The initial goals (subject to change) are to:

* practice building matrix models

* investigate measurements of stability and resilience using such models

* think about the consequences of metapopulation structure for resilience

* practice using RMarkdown and GitHub
